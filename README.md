## Deployment

In production, serve the built files with a static web server (e.g., nginx).  
Example nginx config (simplified):

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name taufer-tales.example.com;

  root /var/www/taufer-tales/dist/taufer-tales-web;

  location / {
    try_files $uri /index.html;
  }

  location /api {
    proxy_pass https://backend.example.com;
  }
}
```
